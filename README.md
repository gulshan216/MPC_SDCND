# CarND-Controls-MPC

## Rubric Discussion Points

* The model:

The model used is a Kinematic model neglecting the complex interactions between the tires and the road. The model equations are as follow:

```
x[t] = x[t-1] + v[t-1] * cos(psi[t-1]) * dt
y[t] = y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(psi[t-1]) * dt
psi[t] = psi[t-1] + v[t-1] / Lf * delta[t-1] * dt
v[t] = v[t-1] + a[t-1] * dt
cte[t] = f(x[t-1]) - y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(epsi[t-1]) * dt
epsi[t] = psi[t] - psides[t-1] + v[t-1] * delta[t-1] / Lf * dt
```
Where:

- `x, y` : Car's position.
- `psi` : Car's heading direction.
- `v` : Car's velocity.
- `cte` : Cross-track error.
- `epsi` : Orientation error.

Those values are considered the state of the model. In addition to that, `Lf` is the distance between the car of mass and the front wheels (this is provided by Udacity's seed project). The other two values are the model output:

- `a` : Car's acceleration (throttle).
- `delta` : Steering angle.

The objective is to find the acceleration (`a`) and the steering angle(`delta`) in the way it will minimize an objective function that is the combination of different factors such as `cte` and `epsi` and a few others.

* Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt):
The number of points(`N`) and the time interval(`dt`) define the prediction horizon. I tried to keep the horizon around the same time the waypoints were on the simulator. With too many points the controller starts to run slower, and some times it went wild very easily. After trying with `N` from 10 to 20 , it caused too many oscillations and hence I decided to leave them fixed to 10 and 100 milliseconds to have a better result tuning the other parameters.

* Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing:

First the waypoints coordinates are transformed to use the car coordinates using the
current poistion of the car (x,y) and the angle at which the car is pointing (-psi)
This helps with 2 things: definint the state and the visualization of the points on the map
This really makes the state very simple: state << 0, 0, 0, v, cte, epsi. 

* Model Predictive Control with Latency:
The state needs to account for latency. Since the car keeps going with the current state
of the actuators, we simply include that movement on our calculated state: (0, 0, 0, v, cte, epsi)

```
px = v * latency;
py = 0;
psi = psi + ((v/ Lf)*delta*latency);
cte = cte + (v * sin(epsi) * latency);
epsi = epsi + psi;
v  = v + accel * latency;
```

we use the previous value of the actuators to calculated this shift due the latency.
Then the model is able to calculate an optimal path based on the state.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
